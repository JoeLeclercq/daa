Three executables are contained within this folder.

The file "nQueens" is an executable that calculates and outputs the solution for Problem 1.
Run using "./nQueens" and enter an input size, or alternatively pipe it in (e.g. "echo "4" | ./nQueens)

The file "nQueens_all" calculates and outputs the solution for Problem 2.
Run in the same way as nQueens.

The file "nQueens_all_no_out" calculates the same information as 2, but skips the printing of
solutions. This is useful for larger n where the number of outputs would be ridiculous.
