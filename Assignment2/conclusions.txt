I felt that this problem was a slightly easier version of the Assignment1
question, since it essentially used the same backbone but with less
validation of each position. 

I was able to practice having several loop change conditions that each
do different things based on whether or not to backtrack and the status
of different variables.

When I initially did this, the final test input took 4 minutes,
which felt long although understandable since we're doing an exhaustive
search on n! possibilities. For speeding this up, I tried to implement
multiprocessing with multiple threads, but ended up only increasing the
runtime of the program. I'm not sure why that is, but it went from 4.5
to 6.5 minutes runtime for n=13. I'll have to do more research for that.
